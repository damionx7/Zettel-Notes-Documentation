The expander may also contain date and/or time placeholders in [SimpleDateFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html); surrounding these with `$$` will cause the expansion to expand them using the current date and time. For example, `## $$yyy-MM-hh (EE)$$` will be expanded to to the current date, formatted like `2024-07-26 (Fri)`.
