title: GIT Synchronization

Git synchronization works only with files in private storage of Zettel Notes (due to storage access framework restrictions). 

To setup git repository, select `Setup GIT` while setting up new [repository](../index.md)

!!! tip

    For Github you will need to use [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) instead of password.

## How the app handles conflicts ?

When a note is changed, the app follows following process to synchronize changes with the Git server:

1. **Commit**: Any local changes made to the notes are first committed.
2. **Rebase**: The app attempts to rebase the local changes with the changes from the server. This method integrates changes without creating unnecessary merge commits.
3. **Merge** (if rebase fails): If conflicts arise during the rebase, the app falls back to a merge operation to combine the changes.
4. **Push**: All the changes are pushed to the git server.

**Merge Conflict Resolution Options:**

You can configure how conflicts are resolved via the Synchronization Settings. The app allows you to choose whether to prioritize changes made on the client (Android device) or the server (Git server) when conflicts occur. By default, OURS conflict resolution strategy is followed.

- Client Preference (OURS): Local changes on the Android device take precedence.
- Server Preference (THEIRS): Remote changes on the Git server take precedence.
