## F-Droid repository

You can download Zettel Notes and my other android apps via F-Droid and receive all updates through it.

You need to add my F-Droid repository as a third-party repository by using this Url.

```
https://thedoc.eu.org/fdroid/repo
```

Confirm that the repository fingerprint matches
